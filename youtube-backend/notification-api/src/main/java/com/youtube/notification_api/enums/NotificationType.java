/*
enum (short for enumeration) is a special class in Java used to represent a fixed set of constants.

Instead of using plain strings or numbers, you group related values under one type.

enum like a menu in a restaurant 🍽️.
If the menu says: "Pizza, Burger, Pasta" → you can only pick one of those.
You cannot order "Car" or "Laptop".
